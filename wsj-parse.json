{"sentence": "But this year, when the hullabaloo surrounding its centennial died, so too did some advertiser interest."},
{"sentence": "The reason, ad executives say, is that the entire magazine business has been soft -- and National Geographic has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market."},
{"sentence": "Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices -- $130,000 for a four-color page, vs. $47,000 for the Smithsonian, a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation."},
{"sentence": "When ad dollars are tight, the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers, who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all."},
{"sentence": "To combat that problem, National Geographic, like other magazines, began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines -- for example, ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest 25 markets."},
{"sentence": "Time magazine, for example, has more than 100 separate editions going to different regions, top management, and other groups."},

{"sentence": "In the past, says Armco's chief economist John Corey, steelmakers made a product and set it out on the loading dock."},
{"sentence": "Armco's sales representatives visit the General Motors Corp.'s Fairfax assembly plant in Kansas City, Mo., two or three days a week."},

{"sentence": "Cementing such relationships with major clients -- car and appliance makers -- is a means of survival, especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and flirting with plastic and aluminum makers."},
{"sentence": "For example, when Detroit began talking about plastic-bodied cars, the American Iron and Steel Institute began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by simply redesigning how a car door is assembled."},

{"sentence": "Almost all capital-improvement programs announced by major steelmakers within the past year involve building electrogalvanizing lines, used to produce steel for such products as household appliances and car doors."},

{"sentence": "But, they say, people shouldn't try to be traders, who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock."},
{"sentence": "The case for owning stocks over the long-term is compelling."},
{"sentence": "A dollar invested in the stock market in 1926 would have grown to $473.29 by the end of last June, according to Laurence Siegel, managing director at Ibbotson Associates Inc."},
{"sentence": "But a dollar invested in long-term bonds in 1926 would have grown to only $16.56, and a dollar put in Treasury bills would equal a meager $9.29."},
{"sentence": "Over time, the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio."},
{"sentence": "\"If you don't need the money for 10 years, there's a clear-cut case for sticking to a steady core of stocks,\" Mr. Gregory says."},
{"sentence": "Stock-market investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns, says John Blankenship Jr., president of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners."},
{"sentence": "There are some important caveats: Before investing in stocks, individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank, most investment advisers say."},
{"sentence": "Individuals also should focus on building equity in a home, which provides some protection against inflation, as well as a nest-egg that can be cashed in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living."},
{"sentence": "People also shouldn't invest money in stocks that they'll need in the near future -- for example, for college tuition payments or retirement expenses."},
{"sentence": "\"You may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge,\" says Mr. Blankenship, a Del Mar, Calif. financial planner."},
{"sentence": "But once the basics are covered, \"then I would start to invest, even if it's as little as $1,000,\" says Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc."},

{"sentence": "Despite the strong case for stocks, however, most pros warn that individuals shouldn't try to profit from short-term developments."},
{"sentence": "\"It's very difficult to do,\" says Donald Holt, a market strategist for Wedbush Morgan Securities, a Los Angeles brokerage firm."},
{"sentence": "\"Our markets move so fast and they are so volatile, there's no way the average investor can compete with the pros.\""},
{"sentence": "Individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market."},
{"sentence": "The cost of executing stock orders varies from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order, but 2% of the order's value is an average, says Stephen Boesel, manager of T. Rowe Price's Growth and Income mutual fund."},
{"sentence": "And assuming their first investment is successful, investors will have to pay taxes on their gains."},
{"sentence": "That can reduce returns by a third or more, once local taxes are included, Mr. Lipper says."},
{"sentence": "After that, individual traders face the risk that the new investment they choose won't perform well -- so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing."},
{"sentence": "\"You should really think twice if you think you can out-smart the system.\""},
{"sentence": "Then, too, many individual investors lack the sturdy emotional makeup professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market."},
{"sentence": "So what's the best way to buy stocks?"},
{"sentence": "\"Unless an individual has a minimum of between $50,000 and $100,000 to invest in stocks, he's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks, in terms of getting enough attention from a competent broker,\" says Mr. Lipper."},
{"sentence": "Still, he adds, \"I could see owning both, given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in spotting special situations based on their own insights,\" he adds."},
{"sentence": "This growth sector, which usually carries a price/earnings multiple about twice that of the Standard & Poor's 500, happens to include some of the market's most attractive bargains right now."},
{"sentence": "\"It's now selling at a multiple about even with the market,\" says Mr. Douglas."},
{"sentence": "Moreover, Mr. Douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term."},
{"sentence": "Many big Wall Street brokerage firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now resuming coverage of this area, he notes."},
{"sentence": "\"We're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks,\" he says."},
{"sentence": "The pros strenuously advise individuals to stay away from the latest investment fad."},
{"sentence": "They say that's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle, when there's no robust bull market to bail investors out of their mistakes."},
{"sentence": "\"Buy stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals,\" he says."},
{"sentence": "In the long run, investment advisers say, most investors will be better off using the dollar-cost averaging method of buying stocks."},
{"sentence": "In this method, a person invests a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down."},
{"sentence": "That cuts the risk, Mr. Gregory, the San Francisco money manager, points out."},
{"sentence": "\"When the market is low, you are buying more shares, and when it's high, you're buying fewer shares,\" he says."},
{"sentence": "Otherwise, if you put all your money in at one time, by sheer bad luck, you might pick a terrible time, and have to wait three years to get even, Mr. Gregory says."},
{"sentence": "A disciplined program will work the best, Mr. Boesel says."},

{"sentence": "When ad dollars are tight, the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers, who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all."},

{"sentence": "Time magazine, for example, has more than 100 separate editions going to different regions, top management, and other groups."},

{"sentence": "The exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration."},
{"sentence": "The CFTC may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions."},
