This profile was produced by first parsing the `item-r' file here which only
contains those items not included in the gold sh-spband profile, using a variant
of the grammar where the two xp_bridge rules in constructions.tdl were added,
along with ubertagging and the addition of root_bridge to the root symbol.  Then
treebanked this parsed profile, and finally appended this robust `result-r' file
to the one from gold sh-spband.  So in this profile, except for `result', all
of the usual files are copied from the gold sh-spband profile; `result' is the 
appending (and post-sorting) of the gold `sh-spband/result' and this `result-r'.
